# Empass-Emotion-Video


Model7.py contains my latest model for emotion classification.


SVM folder contains emotion recognition through support vector machines.


CNN folder contains my other CNN models used for the purpose of emotion classification.


These are all the different approaches that have been tried for the successful implementation of this project :

1)6 different CNN models have been trained on the FER2013 dataset mixed with the newly generated dataset.
2)4 CNN models have been trained on the kaggle facial emotion dataset with the newly generated dataset.
3)Use of SVM for facial emotion recogniton using facial landmarks with the newly generated dataset.
4)Training CNN models on canny edge converted images of the kaggle dataset with the newly generated dataset.
